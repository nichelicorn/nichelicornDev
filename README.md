# 🌲 Welcome to the root of nichelicorn.dev!

This repo hosts the code for nichelicorn.dev, my own little place on the internet. I share articles, tidbits about things I've learned, and notes about current projects.

Thanks so much for visiting!

### What is happening next?
<!-- This is my first website. I'm using this as a tool to learn React / Gatsby, how to host a website, how to write about tech... There is a lot going on here and I hope you enjoy it! -->
This is my first website. My journey into technology began in earnest at the end of 2020, and I have spent the majority of the last year thinking about code, talking about code, dreaming about code, and even sometimes writing a little bit of it! 👩‍💻

This website is yet another tool to help me learn. My main focus with this one will be React / Gatsby, hosting and maintaining a website, and learning how to write and communicate about technology. My twitter feed is included in the side content, give it a follow if you like what you see. 

Visit the project board to see what's in the works, and everything that's been done already. ✅

If you have any ideas, or would like to submit a PR, please do! Feedback is appreciated, almost as much as a good conversation. 💬
