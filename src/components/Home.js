      <p>This is where I share code and writings about technology, make random observations about life, and detail the exploits of my lively fish!</p>
      <aside>The exploits of the fish mainly involve pooping and eating...</aside>
      <p>Anywhoo, this will all be coming along incrementally as I work on my developer skills and practice JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and dive into learning more technologies!</p>
      <p>Currently, I am working on 👩‍💻 this website, nichelicorn.dev, a hotel management app with an API, and learning how to rollerskate.</p>
