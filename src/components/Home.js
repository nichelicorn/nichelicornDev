        <p>This is where I share code and write about technology, random observations, and the exploits of my lively fish!</p>
        <aside>The exploits of the fish mainly involve pooping and eating...🐟💩</aside>
        <p>Anywhoo, this will all be coming along incrementally as I work on my developer skills and practice JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and dive into learning more technologies!</p>
        <p>Currently, I am working on 👩‍💻 this website, nichelicorn.dev, a hotel management 🏨 app with an API, and learning how to rollerskate. 🛼 Unfortunately for the app, rollerskating and working on this website is a little more fun. 🤷‍♀️ </p>
