          <p><span className="illuminated">üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è </span>Hi there! I'm Nichele D, a technologist from Colorado. I love learning, and lucky for me, JavaScript and front-end engineering lead to plenty of avenues for exploration!</p>
          <p><span className="illuminated">üåä </span>Becoming a software developer is a career pivot for me. I spent most of my professional life in accounting: doing payroll, working on the general ledgers, and preparing financial statements for publicly traded and private capital automotive companies. I learned a lot about analysis, creative problem solving, and working on teams. I love the car business, but the work / life balance isn't the best. Looking for something more creative, I became a licensed massage therapist and esthetician. I find that working one on one with a client to achieve a skin- or body-care goal can be very rewarding. I love building long-term relationships with my guests, and found that each meeting was an opportunity to deepen my understanding of the body and how to navigate complex work relationships. Eventually, I found that I couldn't get what I needed out of accounting or spa work, and so when the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, I started seriously considering my options. Hoping to combine my interests in art, the future, and learning, I found my way into a front-end engineering bootcamp.</p>
          {/* I started out in tech hoping to build beautiful things, practice being creative, and contribute to something meaningful. Mostly I was looking for work that would challenge me to grow. So in 2020, after much thought, and in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, I enrolled in a software engineering bootcamp. I learned a lot! And I was happy to discover that I have so much more to learn. */}

          <p><span className="illuminated">üìö </span>When I was in college, I would joke with my mom that I wanted to be a student forever. ü§ì  It wasn't really a joke, but I also believed the stories that I was supposed to become an adult, so I got a job instead of going to grad school. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Fortunately, it's possible to learn so much now, thanks to the Internet! As I move into my future as a technologist, I bring my knowledge and experience as an artist, accountant, massage therapist, aesthetician, skeptic, science enthusiast, and everything else that fits into the soft recesses of that experience.
